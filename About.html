Public speaking refers to delivering some important topic in front of a group audience. This group could be small or at times big.

      One may think that public speaking is easy as he has the knowledge on a particular subject but there are a lot of intricate things one needs to take care of. Some common mistakes are very often committed by people while delivering a topic on public speaking. All knowledgeable persons can’t become good public speakers.

        We all know the stereotype of the pushy salesperson: they’re aggressive and flexible with the truth, talk a lot, and only have one agenda: to sell to you, regardless of your needs and requirements.

That description is, admittedly, a bit of a cliché (and has probably never been particularly true for good salespeople). But we’ve all met at least one of them in our lives. This one-dimensional method often costs sales, even when the product is an easy sell as described in this informative blog post on improving your sales techniques

      <ol start="1" type=1>
          <b>The most important sales skills for modern salespeople</b> 
          <li><b>Staying on top of trends and new ideas</b>It all starts with knowing what you’re talking about. Prospects today might sometimes even be better informed than salespeople themselves. Today’s sales conversations start much later in the information gathering process than they used to – by the time customers first talk to a salesperson, they are already overwhelmed with information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> tailored sales representative skills and abilities</b>
            You need to know the market and your prospects’ pain points as well as you know your own product. You’ll only ever be truly good at it if you have a genuine interest in developing this knowledge. 

Modern sales skills demand spending more time researching prospects and learning about the market than other traditional sales techniques. This can inform every interaction you have with a prospect from first contact and nurturing to your sales pitch and closing the deal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Emotional intelligence: connecting with customers</b>
            It’s “the age of social” – that doesn’t just refer to social networks, but also to a social skillset. If the salesperson of the past was a talker, the modern sales representative shows skills of a listener, who is sensitive to customers’ needs and preferences
          </li>
          <li><b>Customer collaboration skills: Working with the customer</b>
            As the sporting cliché says, teamwork makes the dream work. This applies too to sales where the modern purchasing experience has shifted to a more collaborative model. As a salesperson, you want to make the shoppers feel empowered in their decision to buy your product.

        >Understanding your Will power</a
      >
      <h3>What Is Willpower? The Psychology Behind Self-Control</h3>
      <p>People use different definitions to describe willpower, but some of the most common synonyms are: drive, determination, self-discipline, self-control, self-regulation, effortful control.

        At the core of willpower is the ability to resist short-term temptations and desires in order to achieve long-term goals. It’s the prevailing source of long-term satisfaction over instant gratification.
        
        Willpower is the key to success. Successful people strive no matter what they feel by applying their will to overcome apathy, doubt or fear.
        
        Dan Millman
        
        According to APA (American Psychological Association), most psychology researchers define willpower as:
        
        The ability to delay gratification and resist short-term temptations to meet long-term goals;
        The capacity to override an unwanted thought, feeling or impulse;
        The conscious, effortful regulation of the self, by the self;
        A limited resource capable of being depleted.
        The general idea linking these definitions is of a self effortfully regulating the self.
        
        Studies show that people scoring high on self-control are more apt at regulating behavioral, emotional and attention impulses to achieve long-term goals when compared to more impulsive individuals.
        
        For most of us, when we think of willpower, the first things to pop to mind are the challenges that require us to resist temptation. How do we refuse that chocolate cake, the department store, the internet, that cigarette, or that after-work drink?
        
        It is hard. We have trouble saying “no” when our bodies and senses are screaming yes.
        
        Psychologist Kelly McGonigal calls this the “I won’t power.” McGonigal is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University and the author of  “The Willpower Instinct.” In this latest text, she tackles the concept of self-control and why it matters.
        
        According to her, saying “no” is just one part of what willpower is. But the other part of willpower is “saying yes” to the things you know will lead you closer to your goals. It’s the ability to do what you need to do, even if you don’t feel like it, or a part of you doesn’t want to follow through.</p>
